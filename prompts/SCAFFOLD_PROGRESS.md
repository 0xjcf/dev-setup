# ðŸš€ Dev-Setup Scaffold Progress

This file tracks the status of both the scaffold documentation prompts (`*.md`) and their corresponding implementation within the `bootstrap.sh` script.

- **Prompt Status:** Reflects the review and standardization of the `.md` file itself.
- **Implementation Status:** Reflects whether the logic in `bootstrap.sh` for this scaffold type is complete and tested.

## Node.js

- **API (`node:api`)**
  - [x] Prompt: `node/api-scaffold.md` (Reviewed & Updated)
  - [x] Implementation: Fully implemented and tested in `bootstrap.sh`. (Template path fixes verified)
- **UI (Next.js) (`node:ui`, `--framework=next`)**
  - [x] Prompt: `node/ui-next-scaffold.md` (Reviewed & Updated)
  - [x] Implementation: Fully implemented and tested.
- **UI (Vite) (`node:ui`, `--framework=vite`)**
  - [x] Prompt: `node/ui-vite-scaffold.md` (Reviewed & Updated)
  - [x] Implementation: Fully implemented and tested.

## Rust

- **API (Axum) (`rust:api`)**
  - [x] Prompt: `rust/api-scaffold.md` (Created & Updated)
  - [ ] Implementation: Needs verification after template path fixes.
- **CLI (Clap) (`rust:cli`)**
  - [x] Prompt: `rust/cli-scaffold.md` (Created & Updated)
  - [ ] Implementation: Needs verification after template path fixes.
- **Agent (`rust:agent`)**
  - [x] Prompt: `rust/agent-scaffold.md` (Updated)
  - [ ] Implementation: Needs verification after template path fixes.

## Go

- **Agent (`go:agent`)**
  - [x] Prompt: `go/agent-scaffold.md` (Updated)
  - [ ] Implementation: **Not implemented** in `bootstrap.sh`.

> **Note:** We're in the process of verifying each scaffold implementation with the new template path and variable handling fixes. Each implementation will be marked complete as it's tested and verified.

*(Note: `[x]` indicates the documentation `.md` file itself has been reviewed/created/updated to the desired standard. It does not necessarily mean the underlying `bootstrap.sh` implementation for that scaffold type is complete.)*
